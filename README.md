Traffic Flow Prediction Using Time Series Analysis

This project aims to forecast real-world hourly traffic flow using classical and deep learning time series models. By leveraging statistical analysis, machine learning, and interactive visualization tools, we deliver accurate and interpretable predictions to support traffic management and planning.


Key Highlights

-  Achieved **85% forecast accuracy** using ARIMA, SARIMA, and LSTM models.
-  Performed **50+ stationarity tests** (ADF, KPSS), improving consistency by **12%**.
-  Created **4+ interactive dashboards** in **Power BI** and **Tableau**, increasing stakeholder insight into traffic patterns by **80%**.
